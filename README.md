# attack for saliency
ECE 6258 final project: Saliency detection via adversarial attack on image segmentation task

In this project, the objective focused on investigating the image saliency for a target-specific convolutional neural network on the classification task by evaluating its robustness with the presence of visually-subtle adversarial perturbations. The main goal is to reach a saliency mask generated from local perturbed noise attack to demonstrate how neural network classifies its given object.

We use two datasets for attack purpose: one is ImageNet and the other is from [DeepEyeNet](https://github.com/waynewu6250/DeepEyeNet-Keywords). First we train a ResNet50 model based on
